## Features

### Design

We've created a new design, beautiful and modern design for our app. Fonts, colors and gaps are as modern as possible. Also we've added so much customization options, and we will tell you about them later.

### Keyboard support

You can use keyboard, for all buttons on the calculator. Also, for **⌃ AC ⌫ = ×** buttons we used **Alt Del Backspace Enter Esc** keyboard buttons respectively.

### Customization

We've added a new ⌃ button for changing your settings, just press it, and after that you can change settings. With 123 keys you will change theme, with 456 you will change roundness, and with 0 key you can change buttons transparency. With AC you will change setting to default, also +- changes window size and \* changes font size.
